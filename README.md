Env-WorldGenScripts
===================

Contains a number of simple python scripts for randomly generating world areas, NPCs, enemies, weapon types, armor,
and 'loot'. All scripts are quite basic and work off of the central dictionary, dict.py, which I update with the
necessary generation values.

Note that if you're on of the kind souls who help me playtest this, these script are not kept up to date as strictly as
my local copies, so you might notice a few differences.
